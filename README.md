## Description of the Project

In corruption cleaner, your goal is to clean the level, while also surviving from the attacks of the angry trees. You may wash the tree's with your bubble gun to make them normal again, and then they turn into flowers/lilypads.
Purchase upgrades, aim for a better time, save a large amount of trees, the choice is yours.

## Instructions for Use

Press play on the itch page.
https://titontgc.itch.io/corruption-cleaner

Keybinds: 
- WASD or up,down,left,right arrows
- E to switch fire mode
- ctrl to dodge

## How It Works

Trees spawn in waves, each wave increased the amount of spawns exponentially.
After cleaning each tree off of its corruption, you may use the points you gain to buy upgrades to help you.
Once you clean each tile (there's 10,000) of them, the game ends and you win, at the end it will show you your stats.
Each time you play will look slightly different, as the tiles are proceduraly generated.

## What I Am Most Proud of in the Assignment

Probably the bubbles exploding and effecting the tiles around them, its really neat and satisfying
